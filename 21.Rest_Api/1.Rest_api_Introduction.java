//suppose lets say if user wants to connect with server.inorder to connect with server you require api.for example if client asks for data
//servlet gives the data to client.servlet can give data in two formats 1.xml format 2.json format.
//whenever server sending data the state of an object(simply values of an object) is converted into json format.that means converting object into state(json state/xml state) is called
//representational state transfer.because servelets not returning objects they are returning state of objects
//we can implement Rest in 2 ways 1.jersey 2.spring
